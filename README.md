# AANN.AI Labs
## About us

 ***AANN.AI Labs*** is a leading research and development team that leverages cutting-edge technologies to solve complex problems in various domains such as natural language processing and graph data analysis.

We apply the state-of-the-art technologies to apply them to real-world problems that require extracting valuable insights from data. To achieve these goals, the team performs the following tasks:

* Researching novel techniques and methods for natural language processing and graph data analysis, such as neural networks, large language models, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, clustering, classification, text generation, fact-checking, and more.

* Developing and testing AI-based systems and applications that leverage these techniques and methods, such as intelligent assistants, chatbots, recommender systems, social network analysis, and more.

* Evaluating and improving the performance, usability, and reliability of these systems and applications, using various metrics and feedback mechanisms.

We store and process diverse types of data from both our own application and external sources. This enables us to provide a robust and reliable metric of social authenticity score that reflects the quality and credibility of online interactions.

## Our principles 
### A private GitLab repository fortified with Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment
* (CI/CD) pipelines
* Automatic code build feature, streamlining the development process
* Automatic static code analysis to maintain code quality and identify potential issues
* Automatic unit testing for prompt detection and resolution of errors
* Automatic deployment to various environments in Kubernetes

### Kubernetes (K8S), a docker orchestration system
* Seamless deployment to any cloud or bare-metal host
* Blue/Green deployment strategy for reduced downtime and risk
* Automatic microservices scaling to manage high load conditions
* Automatic load balancing for optimal distribution of network traffic
* Log collection for simplified troubleshooting and system monitoring

### A comprehensive code base
* A Web3 connector microservice that provides a secure connection to any EVM blockchain, enabling method calls and smart contract event subscriptions
* A user management microservice offering user registration, authorization, and data storage
* A Gateway (watchdog) microservice, facilitating communication between microservices and user connection
* Swagger implemented for automatic API documentation
* Each microservice is already fortified with security systems, equipped with a request cache, and connected to its own database

### The development process is divided across three environments
* Staging for development and Research & Development (R&D) activities
* Testing for Quality Assurance (QA) and demo of new features
* Production as a ready-to-use environment

### Development practices at AANN.ai Labs
* We adhere to a robust Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), with all code undergoing cross code review
* Our team follows the SCRUM development methodology, promoting iterative progress and flexibility
* We employ unit tests for our code to ensure its functional integrity
* We abide by Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and SOLID principles to deliver maintainable and scalable code
